			<p>My research interests are atom-photon interaction, collective dynamics of atoms, and non-Markovian dynamics. Here are the brief introduction to my research during graduate studies.</p>

			<h2>Vacuum-induced collective quantum beats</h2>
      <p>Quantum Beats are intereference phenomena in the spontaneous emission from multiple excited levels to the common ground level of an emitter; one would typically observe modulation in the exponentially decaying spontaneous emission profile where the modulation frequency corresponds to the energy difference between the excited levels. It is the lack of which-path information that makes quantum beats to show up; for example, when the emitter decays from a single excited state to multiple ground states, there is no quantum beats as the observer distinguishes which path the emitter took by measuring the final state of the emitter.</br></br>
			Typically quantum beats have been observed in the system prepared in the superposition state of the excited levels. We experimentally showed that the quantum beats may also show even when the emitter is prepared in only one of the excited states, because the vacuum electromagnetic(EM) field may couple the different excited states during the spontaneous decay process (<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.073604" target="blank">Han, Lee et al, PRL 2021</a>). Such behavior has been predicted earlier (<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0954-8998/6/1/003" target="blank">Hegerfeldt and Plenio, Quantum Opt 1994</a>), but has never been observed due to the small effect of vacuum coupling. In our work, we employed superradiance mode where the general coupling strength between the atoms and the vacuum mode is enhanced by a factor of square root of the number of atoms. We also observed that the amount of the vacuum-induced quantum beats shows linear enhancement as the number of atoms increases.</br></br>
			We further theoretically investigated vacuum-induced collective quantum beats for the case of delocalized atoms interacting through a one-dimensional waveguide (<a href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.107.013701" target="blank">Lee et al, PRA 2023</a>). We showed that another characteristic length scale called beat wavelength comes when considering multiple transitions. Thus, for delocalized atoms, as the phase lag between the atom in terms of the optical wavelength determines whether the atoms would superradianctly or subradiantly decay, also the phase in terms of the beat wavelength determines whether the quantum beats is enhanced or suppressed. Furthermore, we investigated exotic behavior of quantum beats in the non-Markovian regime where the bath's correlation time (i.e., the photon's travel time between the atoms) becomes comparable to the system dynamics time (i.e., decay time of individual atom). In such regime, the dispersion of photon due to propagation results in beat enhancemet larger than that of Markovian case or limited suppression.
